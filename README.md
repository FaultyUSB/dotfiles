# My vimrc Repo! 
A repo which holds my .vimrc config file and auto-installation script. 

## Installation
To clone and run the installation script, here is the command to do so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onn-a-qazilbash/vimrc.git && chmod +x vimrc/vimInstall.sh && vimrc/vimInstall.sh
```

Please do not blatantly copy and run random commands you find online, make sense of them first before doing so ;)

For explanation, the first sequence of the command simply clones the repository to your local machine, then the `chmod +x` command will give the installation script 
executable permissions, then the last sequence will execute the installation script.
